Excellent Elements For Data Science, Statistics, Machine Learning

Many people I know have asked how to learn data science. They want to either become data scientists or use data skills in their work. To help everyone, I made this guide and posted it online. Now anyone can access it. My goal is to explain the basics for those starting in data science or who want to use data more in their jobs. If you're interested in this field, I hope you find this guide helpful as a first step.
